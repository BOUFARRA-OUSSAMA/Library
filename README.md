## Development server

To start the development server, run:
```bash
ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

To generate a new component, run:
```bash
ng generate component component-name
```
You can also use:
```bash
ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module
```

## Build

To build the project, run:
```bash
ng build
```
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

To execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io), run:
```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

To execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice, run:
```bash
ng e2e
```
Note: To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
